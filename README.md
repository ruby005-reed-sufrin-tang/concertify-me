## Background

Randall, Spencer, and Ilana made this app with love during project mode at the Flatiron School.

## Features

Some of the nifty things Concertify does:

- Uses the Spotify API to import artists
- Automatically detects your location
- Shows you the most popular events near you
- Sends you emails with event details
- Links to buy tickets and share the event on Facebook
- Recommends similar artists based on your searches

## Usage

Go to [www.Concertify.me](http://www.concertify.me)

## Development/Contribution

If you have any questions or concerns about Concertify (or ideas for features) please send an email to concertify.me@gmail.com.

## Future

We're thinking of integrating with the Google Calendar API but it doesn't seem necessary.
